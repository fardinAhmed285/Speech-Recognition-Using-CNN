My project was done in google collab so the location of the training file needs to be changed according to your computer location however the images location can remain unchanged.


Overview
This project is a speech recognition system built using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It takes audio input, processes it, and classifies the speech into corresponding text labels.

Features:
- Preprocessing of speech data
- Model training and evaluation
- Testing with unseen data
- Visualization of results


Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Librosa
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook


Dataset
- Train and test data are included (or can be downloaded from [dataset link if applicable]).
- Ensure the dataset is placed in the correct folder before running the notebook.

Results
- The model is evaluated using accuracy, loss, and visualizations.
- Outputs include predicted transcriptions for test data.
